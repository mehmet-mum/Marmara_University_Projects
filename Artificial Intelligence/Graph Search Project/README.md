Graph Search Algorithms

  - User gives a maze which contains starting, trap and goal points.
  - Program finds shortest path from starting point to any goal point using following algorithms;
    - Depth First Search
    - Breadth First Search
    - Iterative Deepening
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - Greedy Best First Search
    - A* Heuristic Search
    
Implemented with Python programming language
